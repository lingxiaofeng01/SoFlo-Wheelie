        "heading": "Realistic Physics Engine",
        "content": "At the heart of SoFlo Wheelie lies a sophisticated physics engine that accurately simulates motorcycle dynamics. The game calculates weight distribution, momentum, and balance in real-time, creating a realistic riding experience. When you pull back on the throttle, you'll feel the front wheel lift as the rear tire grips the pavement. Too much throttle, and you'll flip backward; too little, and the wheel drops. Finding that perfect balance point is the key to mastering long, sustained wheelies that will impress your friends and top the leaderboards."

Perform knee tricks where your rider extends their leg while balancing on one wheel. Execute seat stands that demonstrate ultimate control and confidence. Try hand drags that scrape the pavement while maintaining perfect balance. The most daring players can attempt no-hands stunts, removing both hands from the handlebars while keeping the wheelie going. Each trick requires precise timing and control, offering endless opportunities for skill expression and style development."

      {
        "title": "Start Small and Build Gradually",
        "description": "Don't try to hold the longest wheelie on your first attempt. Begin with short wheelies, focusing on finding the balance point. As you become comfortable with the basic mechanics, gradually extend your wheelie duration. This progressive approach builds solid fundamentals and prevents frustration."
      },
      {
        "title": "Master Throttle Control",
        "description": "The throttle is your primary tool for wheelie control. Learn to make small, precise adjustments rather than dramatic inputs. Smooth throttle application helps maintain balance and prevents sudden flips or drops. Practice feathering the throttle to find that sweet spot where the front wheel hovers at the perfect height."
      },
      {
        "title": "Understand Weight Distribution",
        "description": "Your rider's position affects the motorcycle's balance. Pay attention to how different tricks shift weight and change the balance point. Understanding these dynamics will help you maintain control during complex maneuvers and recover from near-crashes."

        "title": "Practice Different Bikes",
        "description": "Each motorcycle in SoFlo Wheelie has unique handling characteristics. Spend time with different bikes to understand their strengths and weaknesses. Some bikes are more forgiving for beginners, while others offer higher performance for experienced players. Finding the right bike for your skill level and style is crucial for progression."
      },
      {
        "title": "Learn from Mistakes",
        "description": "Every crash is a learning opportunity. When you flip backward or drop the front wheel, think about what caused it. Was your throttle input too aggressive? Did you hold the wheelie too long? Analyzing your mistakes helps you avoid repeating them and accelerates your skill development."

            "content": "What makes Wheelie Up truly engaging is its simple yet demanding physics system. The game requires constant micro-adjustments to maintain balance, creating an intense focus that's both challenging and meditative. The physics feel authentic - your bike responds realistically to every input, making success feel earned and crashes feel like learning opportunities.\n\nThe terrain variety ensures that mastering one section doesn't guarantee success in the next. You'll face steep climbs that test your ability to maintain extreme angles, sudden drops that require quick reactions, and flat sections where maintaining momentum becomes the challenge. This diversity keeps the gameplay fresh and prevents it from becoming repetitive.\n\nThe coin placement adds strategic depth to what could otherwise be a pure survival game. Coins are often positioned to tempt you into risky maneuvers, creating interesting risk-reward decisions. Do you go for that coin on a steep slope, or play it safe and focus on distance? These split-second decisions add another layer of engagement to the core wheelie mechanics."
